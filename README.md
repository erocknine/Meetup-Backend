Tired of being invited to places that are too far for comfort? Well, Hangouts allows friended users to conveniently schedule get-togethers with Yelp suggested restaurants in areas mutually close to all parties.

#Start
To begin, run 'bundle install'.
Then run 'rails db:create', and 'rails db:migrate' to create the postgreSQL database.
Then run 'rails s' to start local server. This will create endpoints /meetups, /friends, and /users.
